# Checkpoint: Zero
My 12 IA Prototyping Assessment Game

Yes, the texture are stolen I will be replacing them in the future, but at the moment I'm focusing on getting the game actually to run.
If you find any bugs please create an issue ticket, so that I can fix it, or at least try.

# How to run the Game/Prototype/TechDemo
Option 1: Download the .jar from the release section

Option 2: You need Eclipse to compile my Game at the moment.

1. Open Eclipse
2. Go to File/Import
3. Select General/Existing Projects into Workspace
4. Select the downloaded copy of my repositry
5. In the Projects field select both folders
6. Press finish

Now you have the project in your Eclipse workspace.
The main code is in the core directory, so any programming or whatever you wanna do has to happen here. 
In the desktop directory is only the DesktopLaucher. You shouldn't need to change anything here.

To start the game simply run the DesktopLauchner class in the Desktop directory.

# Controlls
Use the arrow keys to move the cursor and press enter to place a tower.
